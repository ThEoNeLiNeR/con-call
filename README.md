# con-call

Initial Thoughts about this application :
- People should be able to request for a call to anyone in the entire app ecosystem.
- Should have the option to handle multiple calls together.
- Should be able to make group calls too.
- Recording should also be possible.
- Transcripts and summary should be available using AI.
- Resolution should be auto-adjustable or specific.
- Call Analytics should be present on the dashboard.
